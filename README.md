# League Speak - German
> Simple Tool to put your speech into the Leauge of Legends Chat

## It is important that this Version translates German into English

## How to install
1. Open a Command Line in your wanted destination
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to `/leagueSpeak-german`
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `py LeagueSpeak.py`

## How to use
When the script is open, everytime you press G your voice will be recorded and translated to english text.
Everytime your voice is recorded, it will be printed to the console window.

I would suggest you wait a very short duration after pressing G so nothing of your voice is cut.

I suggest to only use it in a game of league of legends.
